- I'd like my latex plugin in vscode to generate the file like that automatically. Can THAT be configured?
- complete latex_spanish/
- gather screenshots, data, folder data, create github repo
- update to remove the quotes of my previous text in spanish, since this report should be independent of that, otherwise it looks really strange. The reader doesn't know that there was a previous text in spanish and doesn't understand why that appears there. Just explain the thing! Don't quote me. Quote references and everything as you're doing great, but not me!
